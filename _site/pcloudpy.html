    <p>Point Cloud Viewer and Processing Toolkit in Python</p>

<p>This toolkit aims at providing an ease interface to display point clouds in many formats and performing diverse filtering processes. 
This project goal is to make use of amazing libraries such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, IPython, VTK, pandas, sklearn, laspy, pyside, pyqode and so on to be used in the display and processing of point clouds.
<strong>pcloudpy</strong> project is highly inspired in Paraview, MeshLab, CloudCompare, FreeCad, PCL.  It attempts to offer an alternative to add modules written in python easily. 
An IPython Console and a Python Editor are also available in order to interact with the pcloudpy api and graphical user interface.</p>
